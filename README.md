# NGINX

# Terraform AWS ECS Fargate Project

This project deploys a simple Nginx web application using **AWS ECS (Fargate)**, an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**, and supporting infrastructure using **Terraform**.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed and configured:
- An **AWS account** with appropriate permissions.
- **Terraform** (latest version installed).
- **AWS CLI** (configured with your credentials using `aws configure`).

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/NGINX.git
   cd NGINX
Initialize Terraform:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
Review the Terraform Plan:

bash
Copy code
terraform plan
Apply the Configuration:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
Type yes to confirm resource creation.
Access the Application:

Copy the ALB DNS name from the Terraform outputs.
Open the application in your browser:
arduino
Copy code
http://<ALB_DNS_NAME>

| `outputs.tf`       | Specifies outputs, such as the ALB DNS name, ECS Cluster name, and Task ARN.|
| `.gitignore`       | Excludes `.terraform/` and state files from version control.                |
| `README.md`        | Documentation for understanding and deploying the project.                  |

## Resources Created

This Terraform configuration creates the following AWS resources:

### ECS Cluster
- A cluster to host the ECS tasks.

### ECS Task Definition
- Defines the Nginx container task to be run on Fargate.

### Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Routes incoming HTTP traffic to the ECS service.

### IAM Roles
1. **Task Role**: Grants permissions for the ECS tasks to interact with AWS services.
2. **Execution Role**: Allows ECS to pull container images and write logs.

### Security Group
- Configured to allow inbound HTTP traffic on port 80.


## üì§ Outputs

After running `terraform apply`, the following outputs will be displayed:

- **ALB DNS Name**: The public DNS name of the Application Load Balancer (use this to access the app).
- **ECS Cluster Name**: The name of the ECS cluster created.
- **Task Definition ARN**: The ARN of the ECS task definition.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Exclude State Files
- The `.terraform/` directory and `terraform.tfstate` files are excluded from version control using `.gitignore`.

### Destroy Resources
- To avoid unnecessary AWS charges, destroy the resources when they are no longer needed:
  ```bash
  terraform destroy

## üõ° Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check the following:

1. **AWS CLI Configuration**:
   - Ensure your credentials are configured correctly using:
     ```bash
     aws configure
     ```

2. **Terraform Plan**:
   - Always run `terraform plan` before applying changes to catch any errors.

3. **Security Group**:
   - Verify that the security group allows inbound HTTP traffic on port 80.
